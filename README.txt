Health and Finisher:
    When a player is attacked, their health is reduced. Both players have 100 health, and the first to reach 0 loses. This is represented in the healthbar, displayed at the top of the screen.

    When a player sucessfully lands an attack, they gain finisher meter. When a player gains finisher meter, their finisher bar increases. This is represented in the blue finisher bar beneath the healthbar. When a players finisher bar is filled, they can unleash their high damage finisher move!

Blocking and Parrying:
    When a player blocks, they take no damage. If a player uses a Heavy Attack on a blocking player, they can break their block.
    As soon as a player presses the block key, if they are attacked by their opponent within a short period of the key being pressed they will execute a parry. This provides finisher meter to the player, whilst stunning the opponent long enough for the player to launch an attack.


The Menus:
    A player will navigate the menus using their mouse. The main menu takes the player to the character selection screen, and then to the main game. The settings menu allows the players to disable music and sound effects. The leaderboard displays the top 5 quickest times, try to beat them to get your name on the leaderboard! 
    The player can press the escape key to enter the pause time at any time during the main game, with the options to resume, restart the match or to quit.
